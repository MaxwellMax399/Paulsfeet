  <h1>My top 3 favorite Book&amp;Manwha</h1>
  <p>In this page, I'll be talking about my top 3 favorite book and manga and I've already listed the three below for you to see<p>

    <ol>
    <li>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</li>
    <li>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</li>
    <li>SSS-Class Suicide Hunter</li>
    </ol><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr>

    <h2>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</h2>
    <p>Starting off with Diary of a Wimpy Kid, it's a funny story about a wimpy kid (who would have guessed?) just to laze around life and enjoy himself, but his parents and school are an obstacle to his objective, but he finds a way around them. If you want to find out how he does it, I recommend that you start reading the book, and I promise you won't regret it. You'll laugh till tears start coming out of your eyes that's how funny the book is.</p><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr>

    <h2>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</h2>
    <p>ORV for the short version of the name and there's so many ways I can talk about this manwha but to keep it short it's about Kim Dokja who was reading an unpopular book called, "Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse," untill it suddenly ended and turned to reality. He is the only one aware on how the future will unfold and he uses it to the best of his abilties to survive, my explanation doesn't scratch the surface of this manwha, if you read deeper in, you'll see how he isn't the only one who read the book and that there are other who sort of know the future but just the main difference being that kim was the only one who read it all but there still dangerous nevertheless since they don't use it for good. The plot is a little hard to understand but the moment you start reading you'll get, somwhat, but other than that; the drama, fight scenes and plot are all beautiful crafted</p><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr>

    <h2>SSS-Class Suicide Hunter</h2>
    <p> It starts of pretty slow, at first when I read it I thought it was just another regression slop where they just become op eventually, you know, predictable stories, then I dropped it but after a while I came back to read it since well it'd just be another slop I read right? Wrong. the moment you get half way past arc 1 or get to arc 2 the story takes off and it does not look back, the character growth, stories that tug at your heart string and the way the showed it with the art, it was majestic. Honestly I am so glad that it popped up again and I don't regret reading it, my favorite arc was the murim one, the way they handled it and wrote it was beautiful and honestly might be the best arc I read in my life, I'm being a bit hyperbolic with that but it was that good but again just the downside being with how it started but later on it makes up for it, massively.</p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p> that's basically it for the books&amp;manwha I read and honestly some arcs within it helped me a bit in my life. I don't regret reading em and out all of it, SSS-Class Suicide Hunter is my favorite just the way it tugs on your heartstrings and character growth within the main mc and people around them hits me, this doesn't mean the other 2 are worse because of this, they're great but that one hits diffferent, for me anyways.</p>
